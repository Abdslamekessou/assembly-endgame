# Assembly Endgame 🎮

A fun React mini-game built during the **freeCodeCamp React Course**.  
It’s like Hangman, but with a programming twist!

## 🚀 Features
- Built with **React + Vite**
- Hot reload for smooth development
- Simple but fun word-guessing game
- Deployed on **Vercel**

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Start the game by running:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdslamekessou/assembly-endgame.git
   cd assembly-endgame
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Then open the game in your browser.


The computer picks a secret word.

You guess letters, one by one.

✅ Correct letter → revealed in the word.

❌ Wrong letter → you lose one programming language from your stack.

Keep guessing until:

You reveal the whole word = You Win 🎉

You run out of programming languages = Game Over 💀
